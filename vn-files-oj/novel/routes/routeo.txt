me As I opened the door to the school rooftop my heart nearly skipped a beat
$ns
me I have admired my classmate Sora since freshman year
me Never would I think to have the courage to so much as go up to her
me In fact if you had explained this scene to me prior I would have laughed you out of the room
$ns
me And yet, just days before graduation I had summoned the courage of all my ancestors and slipped a note onto her desk
me The note read:
{fulltxt=false}
me 'Meet on the school rooftop after classes ❤ - anonymous'
{fulltxt=true}
me A stupid note I know, but it was the only thing my heavily beating heart and shaking hand could eek out
$ns
me Shaking my head, I snap myself out of my thoughts and back into the present moment
me Stalling isn't going to do me any good, now was my one and only chance
me I grad the handle to the door
$ns
me I push it open and.........

{fulltxt=false, bg=main, charc=s}
me I stop in my tracks
me Juxtaposed against the blue sky, Sora looked more beautiful than she ever could in the classroom
me My mind started spinning in circles
me I can't believe she came!, what does she think of me?, what do I say?, I must look stupid
me I shove all those thoughts aside
me Even with my mind in a fog, I knew this would be my last chance to express how I really felt
me All my school years had been leading up to this moment
me Now is my only chance before today's brief surge of confidence diminishes
me I was certain that today, regardless of the outcome would be one of, if not the most important day of my life
me ...
me With nobody to interrupt me I open my mouth and say...
p PO!
me huh?
p POPO!
me It was like bad karma, bestowed onto me for stalling
p POPPOPOPO!
me The voice got louder
me My mood quickly switched from distraught to rage
me Who/What could possibly come interrupt me at this very moment
me Nobody ever wants to talk to me until this absolute worst possible moment
me Out of nowhere something runs in between me and Sora
{charc=p}
me ...
p ...
me I stare at it
p *Stares back*
me I size it up
me It was some sort of small creature
me It looked to be a strange hybrid girl/hamster/mouse thing
me I continue staring as it stares back, not uttering a word
{charc=p3}
me As I look into its eyes an unspeakable rage starts to well up from inside of me
me A rage that could only be brought on by piercing eyes such as these
me Who knew something this cute could garner such a negative reaction
{charc=p}
p POPO!
me My eye twitches
p POPOPO!
me That’s it
mes Get out of the way!
mes Or your not going to like what happens next!
me The small creature shakes its head
p POPOOPPPOOPO!
{charc=d}
me Suddenly the creature throws me a dice
{charc=p}
me I flinch slightly, catching it my hands
mes Huh?
{charc=p2}
me Out of nowhere an orange banner appears in the sky and numbers labelled ATK/DEF/EVD/HP appear below me and the creature's feet
me My numbers are ATK +1, DEF +0, EVD +0, HP 5 while the creatures are ATK -1, DEF -1, EVD -1, HP 7
p POKKYUPPO!
me I could not be more confused
me My emotions have changed from confident to nervous to enraged to bewildered in such a short period of time
me Though one thing can be certain
me Whether or not I know what is going on will not change the fact
me This creature who interrupted my heartfelt confession to Sora must pay!
mes Bring it on!
me The creature pulls out its own dice from seemingly thin air and rolls it
{charc=p6}
p POIPPO!
{charc=d4}
me Four
{charc=p2}
me The creature rolls a four but I honestly have no idea what that means
me It is now motioning towards me
me I can only guess it is telling me to roll the dice it has given me
{charc=d}
me I hold out the strange dice
me It is about 10x the size of any normal dice with the 1 being an orange dot as opposed to the standard black dots
{charc=clear}
me I throw the dice out in front of me
me Its large size makes its result very obvious
{charc=d2}
me Two
{charc=clear}
me Within an instant It became very clear to me what it meant.
mes Aghh!
me I felt as if a strong wind had knocked some of my life force out of me
me I fall to my knees, coughing from my sudden loss of breath
me Wincing through the pain I manage to look over at Sora
{charc=s}
me She stares her face painted with her usual emotionless expression
me Though before I turn away I think I see a tinge of concern in her eyes
{charc=clear}
me As I stand back up I turn back towards my enemy
{charc=p2}
me Somehow its soulless eyes have become even more antagonizing
me I stop for a moment to regain my energy
me It seems I will need all the energy I can get to survive this battle I have somehow found myself in
me Looking below me my then five hp stat has fallen to a three
me I can only imagine what will happen if it gets to zero
{charc=clear}
me Picking up my dice I roll it
{charc=d4}
me Four
{charc=p2}
me I sneer at my opponent
mes Ha, go ahead and try
{charc=p5}
me In its first change of expression the creatures eyes narrow
me It seems to realize I am getting serious
{charc=p6}
p POTAH!
me It rolls a...
{charc=d3}
me Three
{charc=p2}
me I chuckle
me Maybe this battle will be over sooner than I thought
p POO!
me I wait anxiously to see the creature revel in pain like myself
me Though this reaction is not what I received
me Instead the thing hardly reacts
me I look up at its new hp level
me I begin to sweat
me It is still at a four
me Somehow I overlooked its starting hp stat of seven
me I can't let it get to me
me Shaking any bad thoughts out of my head I prepare for its next roll
{charc=p6}
p POPOPOPOPOPO!!
{charc=d3}
me A three
{charc=battle}
me I feel life coming back into me
me I start to get cocky again
mes Three? Ha! At least try a little
me I ready my dice
$ca
me I close my eyes
me Throwing it in front of me I channel all my luck into this roll
me Though I always thought of myself as pretty unlucky
{bg=main, charc=d}
me As I open my eyes
me A one stares back at me
me At once I am hit with an indescribable wave of pain
{charc=clear}
me I fall backwards
me I feel my conscious slipping
{charc=s}
me I glance at Sora one last time before I pass out

$ca
s Please...
s Please wake up!
{bg=sky, charc=s2}
me My eyes slowly flicker open
me The sight before me almost makes me pass out again
me Above me is Sora
me She is so close I can feel her breath on my sweaty skin
me Her usually placid expression is dropped, replaced by a look of genuine concern
mes So..Sora...
me I barley get my words out
s Why are you doing all this for me?
s Please don't fight anymore
mes I... Just wanted to make you happy
{charc=s4}
me Sora's face once again exhibits a new expression, pure amazement
me Holding myself up with my shaky hands I say in the most genuine way I can
me I struggle to get up
mes You've always seemed so melancholy Sora
mes I just thought that maybe, If I could show you that people care about you...
mes I could see you smile
mes So please
mes Let me finish this
me Breathing heavily I get myself fully up
me I look at Sora and smile
me ...
{charc=clear, bg=main}
me I snap out of it head back towards my enemy

s Wait!
me I look back
{charc=s5}
me Sora's eyes avert my gaze and she begins to blush
me Before I can say anything she rushes towards me and envelops me in a hug
$ca
me Stunned I stand there frozen in shock
s Th...ank you
me She says in a timid voice
me Still mid embrace, she slips something small and flat into my hand
{bg=main, charc=s5}
me Pushing away she looks me in the eyes once before running off to where she was standing
{charc=clear}
me I turn back towards my enemy
{charc=p2}
me All my stress is gone
me I will not fail
me I pickup my dice when the object in my left hand catches my eye
me Thats right, what did Sora give me?
me Looking down I see a card
{charc=c}
me Written on it is a title "Extraordinary Specs"
me Underneath that title is a photo of a girl in a purplish uniform
me She looks a lot like Sora but that’s probably just my imagination
me At the bottom of the card it says "Roll 6 for movement, battle, bonus, and drop."
me I am once again quite confused but I think its best not to question it
me With this I can't lose!
{charc=p2}
me I throw the card down in front of me and stare at my enemy with narrowed eyes
{charc=p4}
me The creature looks bewildered
me As if I have broken the rules
p Pokkyaan!!
me Maybe I have but I do not care
{charc=clear, bg=sky}
me I pickup my dice and hold it to the heavens
mes I'll use everything I have...!
{bg=main}
me I roll my dice
{charc=d6}
me The six appears
{charc=p2}
me The creature is sweating
me Shaking, It rolls its dice
me ...
me ...
me ...
me The dice seems to roll forever
me Finally it teeters back and forth settling on
{charc=d2}
me A two
me In an instant the attack hits the creature sending it flying into the air
{charc=p4}
p Popiiiiiiiii.......
me It screams as it disappears into the sky
{charc=clear}
me I sigh deeply and smile
me I relax for the first time, looking clearly at Sora
{charc=s}
me Her hair blows in the wind, illuminated crimson by the slowly setting sun
me She looks astonished as tears well up in her eyes
me Then
me I see something I'll never forget
{charc=s3}
me Her smile
